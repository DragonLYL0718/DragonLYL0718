## Hi! I am Yilong Lin.

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/computer-science) at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/), supervised by [Prof. Eyal Ofek](https://eyalofek.org/) and [Prof. Massimiliano Di Luca](https://massimilianodiluca.info/) since September 2025.

I recently completed my master's degree in the [School of Design](https://designschool.sustech.edu.cn/en) at the [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), under the supervision of [Prof. Seungwoo Je](https://immersivedesignresearch.com/seungwoo). I earned my B.S. from the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/). I also gained valuable research experience as a visiting student researcher in the [WIT LAB](https://sites.google.com/view/kaist-witlab/) at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) under the supervision of Prof. Ian Oakley.

My research in human-computer interaction focuses on **Haptics, Wearables, Eye Tracking, Visuo-haptic Illusions, Avatars, and Virtual Reality**.

If you are interested in collaborating with me, please feel free to send me an email!
