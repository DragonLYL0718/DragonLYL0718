## ArmDeformation: Inducing the Sensation of Arm Deformation in Virtual Reality Using Skin-Stretching

### Abstract
With the development of virtual reality (VR) technology, research is being actively conducted on how incorporating multisensory feedback can create the illusion that virtual avatars are perceived as an extension of the body in VR. In line with this research direction, we introduce ArmDeformation, a wearable device employing skin-stretching to enhance virtual forearm ownership during arm deformation illusion. We conducted five user studies with 98 participants. Using a developed tabletop device, we confirmed the optimal number of actuators and the ideal skin-stretching design effectively increases the user's body ownership. Additionally, we explored the maximum visual threshold for forearm bending and the minimum detectable bending direction angle when using skin-stretching in VR. Finally, our study demonstrates that using ArmDeformation in VR applications enhances user realism and enjoyment compared to relying on visual feedback alone.
