# About

I am a master's student in the School of Design at the Southern University of Science and Technology, supervised by [Prof. Seungwoo JE](https://www.seungwooje.com/). I will join the [WIT LAB](https://sites.google.com/view/kaist-witlab/) in October as an intern under the supervision of Prof. Ian Oakley.

My research in human-computer interaction focuses on the **Haptic Device, Embodiment Illusion, and Body Ownership with virtual reality**.

I earned my B.S. from the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/).

If you are interested in collaborating with me, please feel free to send me email!
