[Prof. Seungwoo JE](https://www.seungwooje.com/). I earned my B.S. from the [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/). Previously, I was a visiting student researcher in [WIT LAB](https://sites.google.com/view/kaist-witlab/) at [Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology](https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/) under the supervision of Prof. Ian Oakley.
